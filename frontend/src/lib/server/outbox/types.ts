/**
 * Outbox event types. Add new variants here, then handle them in
 * backend/src/lib/outbox/dispatcher.ts.
 *
 * `kind` is a dotted "domain.event" string. The dispatcher looks up the
 * handler by exact match — no inheritance, no fallback dispatching.
 *
 * Each variant carries its own `payload` shape; runtime validation
 * happens in the dispatcher (the JSON column is opaque to Prisma).
